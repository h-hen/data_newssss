Variants and low vaccination rates threaten to prolong the pandemic

California officials announced in April 2020 that a 57-year-old woman who died on February 6 that year passed away from coronavirus complications, more than three weeks before what was previously believed to be the nation's first death, in Washington state.
Since then, at least 601,818 Americans have died from Covid-19, according to the most recent data from Johns Hopkins University. Recent months brought overall fewer cases, hospitalizations and deaths -- progress health experts attribute to vaccines.
With more than 300 million total vaccine doses administered as of this week, the US has gone through major coronavirus milestones worthy of celebration: From reporting a current seven-day moving average of 13,997 daily new cases this week compared to the peak of 251,834 cases on January 10, to administering an average of more than 3 million vaccine doses per day in April, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But there's still a long way to go, CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen warned Saturday evening.
While health experts agree full vaccination offers protection against some variants of Covid-19, Wen added that it's unknown whether a variant resistant to vaccines will emerge.
"We just don't know. If it's anything that we've learned during Covid-19, it's how much we need to be humble in the face of this virus," she said.
She noted that it's "certain" new variants will develop, which could make vaccines slightly ineffective, but not entirely.
"This is another reason why those who are unvaccinated should be vaccinated as soon as possible," Wen said.
